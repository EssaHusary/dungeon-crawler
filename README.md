This is a dungeon crawler video game that I created in the first semester of my computer science degree. The player must escape, fighting monsters along the way, ultimately engaging in a final boss fight that ends the game. From the perspective of the user, here is how it works:

They are prompted to choose a cardinal direction: n for North, s for South, w for West, and e for East. As they navigate the dungeon, they may encounter and pickup new weapons, or they might encounter and fight enemies as they try to escape.
It looks like this:

They may also request to see the map by simply typing "map":

If they engage in a battle with an enemy, then they activate the combat loop.
